/**
 * A Kotlin sequence is a similar concept to a collection (like List or
 * Set), but it is evaluated lazily, meaning the next element is always
 * calculated on demand, when it is needed.
 *
 * Sequences are prefect for sources of data whose size might be big (or infinite)
 * and elements might be heavy, so we want to calculate or read them on demand, lazily.
